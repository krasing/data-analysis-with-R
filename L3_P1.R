# This means the distributions should be somewhat similar,
# but the histograms we created don't show that.

# The 'Fair' and 'Good' diamonds appear to have 
# different distributions compared to the better
# cut diamonds. They seem somewhat uniform
# on the left with long tails on the right.

# Let's look in to this more.

# Look up the documentation for facet_wrap in R Studio.
# Then, scroll back up and add a parameter to facet_wrap so that
# the y-axis in the histograms is not fixed. You want the y-axis to
# be different for each histogram.

# If you want a hint, check out the Instructor Notes.

# The Gapminder website contains over 500 data sets with information about
# the world's population. Your task is to download a data set of your choice
# and create 2-5 plots that make use of the techniques from Lesson 3.

# You might use a simple histogram, a boxplot split over a categorical variable,
# or a frequency polygon. The choice is yours!

# You can find a link to the Gapminder website in the Instructor Notes.

# Once you've completed your investigation, create a post in the discussions that includes:
#       1. any questions you answered, your observations, and summary statistics
#       2. snippets of code that created the plots
#       3. links to the images of your plots

# Copy and paste all of the code that you used for
# your investigation, and submit it when you are ready.
